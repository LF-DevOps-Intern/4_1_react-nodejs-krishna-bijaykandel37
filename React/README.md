React JS

To install react and create a sample app:
Npx create-react-app testapp
==> cd testapp


To start the development server at default port 3000,
==> Npm start


To change the port, edit package.json file:
==> Nano package.json

'PORT=3001' is added with 'start' under 'scripts' and saved and exited.

To run server again, 
==> npm start

And we can verify the running server from the browser, which is running at port 3001.
